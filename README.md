MITRA – Autonomous AI Assistant Rover

Mitra is an intelligent autonomous rover that blends robotics, computer vision, and on-device AI to perceive and interpret real-world environments in real time. Equipped with YOLO-based object detection, MediaPipe pose analysis, lane detection, and a wake-word–activated voice interface, Mitra can recognize people, understand interactions, describe scenes, and communicate naturally using a locally hosted LLM (Ollama). Built on a hybrid architecture using Raspberry Pi 4 (vision + perception) and ESP32 (motor control), Mitra continuously analyzes visual and sensor data, makes context-aware decisions, and narrates its observations like a personal assistant. The system demonstrates seamless human–robot interaction, real-time perception, and autonomous navigation on a lightweight, embedded platform.
